**Project Title:** Jokes Dashboard

**Overview:**
The Jokes Dashboard is a web application that fetches random jokes from an external API and displays them dynamically on a dashboard interface.

- **Display:** Updates the UI dynamically to show the fetched joke.
- **Session Management:** Uses session storage to maintain user login state.
- **User Authentication:** Supports user login and signup functionalities securely.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the dashboard adapts well to various screen sizes.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Firebase Firestore for user data storage.
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (with minimal CSS framework for styling), JavaScript.
- **API:** Integration with an external API for fetching jokes.

**Deployment:** Hosted on a local server or any cloud platform supporting Node.js applications.

**Usage:**
1. **Login/Signup:** Users can register/sign in to access the dashboard.
2. **Dashboard:** Displays a welcome message and a button to fetch jokes.
3. **Fetch Jokes:** Clicking the button updates the dashboard with a new joke fetched from the API.
